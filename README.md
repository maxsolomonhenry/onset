<pre># onset
A Matlab script demonstrating various note onset detection techniques.

To run the script with my examples, download and expand the zip file taking care to keep 
the wav files in the same directory as the script.

The script should be run in sections -- 

(1)     select your example signal on line 49 then run section 1.  Section two (pre-processing) is 
        a curiosity and not connected to the rest of the script; it is not necessary to run.  

(2)     Run one or both of the sections on temporal/spectral detection functions.  

(3)     Run the penultimate section on post-processing and thresholding, taking care to tune the 
        necessary values (as described in the script comments: cutoff, delta, lamba, M).  

(4)     You may optionally run the final section, which will play the example signal with an overlayed 
        track of cowbells corresponding to the detected note onset times.

Enjoy!
